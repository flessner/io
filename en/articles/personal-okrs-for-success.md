# Personal OKRs for Success
```
- O  = Objective   = Ambitious, inspirational & qualitative
- KR = Key Results = Quantitative, Time-Bounded, Binary
```
> Actions - and data - speak louder than words

## Personal OKRs vs Work OKRs
Personal OKRs help you to be more mindful, while work OKRs track how useful you are.
You can be as serious as if they were for work, but you don't have to (e.g. Time Tracking)
They also help with habit building & motivation, which can be displayed depending on the environment.

## Example
```
Objective:â€ŠBoost Knowledge
Key Results:
1. Read 20 books
2. Create 2 open source projects
```

## Tips & Tricks
- Give a reason, why it failed/ was changed!
- Update them regularly with new information
- Don't set too many OKRs instead make the OKRs harder
- Set completion points/checkpoints (e.g. quarterly, monthly, weekly)
