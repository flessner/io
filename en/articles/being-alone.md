# Being Alone
To feel less lonely you need to build a relationship with yourself.
We fill the moments between the zoom meetings with mindless tasks, is it necessary?
Generation Z is the loneliest generation. Loneliness can be as bad as smoking 15 cigarets per day.
First, we need to identify the opposite of loneliness, which is building friendships or dating.
These however are meaningful, but don't stop loneliness or sometimes don't even help.

## The secret of Loneliness
Loneliness always finds a way.
You can be out with friends or just hang up the phone and then suddenly feel lonely.
Most people in such a situation distract themselves by playing a game or tweeting, reading...
The problem is that most see loneliness as a result of lacking social contacts, but is lacking contact with oneself.

## Solitude is key
If you are left with yourself, without distraction, you don't know what you may find.
> 🙊 Why be alone if you don’t have to be?

> 📱 Perhaps because that hollow feeling — the one you get when you’re scrolling on your phone for too long? That doesn’t change after 5 or 10 years of scrolling.

## Strangers to ourselves
Taking a look inward can be scary and difficult, because it is intimidatingly personal.
We don't know ourself as good as we would like to know, which can be perplexing.
The split between how we portray ourselves and who actually are, can never be fully closed, but tightened.

## Learning from Strangers & Shared Humanity
We are like strangers to ourselves so we can learn from interacting with strangers.
We need to treat ourselves like a stranger with whom we need to find out shared points of view.
When we are talking with strangers, we grow curious about them, we need this curiosity with ourselves.

## Don't sweat it & Follow up
Getting to know someone takes time, this also holds true for our inner self.
As more practiced you become the faster and deeper conversations with yourself can unfold and evolve.
> ❗ Getting to know yourself is the first step, build on that and you won't be lonely for a minute of the rest of your life.
