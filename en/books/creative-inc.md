# Creative, Inc. - Running a Successful Freelance Business
If you run a business in a *creative industry*, you'll need to have your fundamentals down.
This comes with having a **mission statement** and all **bureaucracy** done, like paying taxes.

When taking on clients keep them involved in the process.
Great communication isn't a premium, it is a *necessity* in a creative industry.
A good way to build your portfolio as a freelancer is to undercut your competition in price.

Freelancers need a fair *Work-Life-Balance*, maintaining a physical boundary to your workplace helps greatly.
If things aren't working out a couple months in consider returning to a *full-time job*.
Always maintain a **sense of perspective** over your business and the metrics *you* care about.
