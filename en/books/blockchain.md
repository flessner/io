# Blockchain
With the dawn of the internet a couple new problems arrived.
For example hackers made the internet unsafe for e.g. financial transactions.
Blockchain at its core is build to be **unchangeable**.

One example of this advantage is smart contracts, which is an automated contract on the blockchain.
The payment is only received once the negotiated terms are fulfilled, skipping bureaucracy and centralized authorities.

Because Blockchain is fundamentally build upon the *promise to be decentralized*,
it drives power away from centralized structures (e.g. big corporations) and encourages rethinking hierarchies.

Certain blockchain networks have a high energy consumption and are hard to access.
But there are new advancements made every month, like the shift form *Proof of Work* compared to *Proof of Stake*.
**The point is:** The possibilities are endless and it is up to us to put this new technology to good use.
