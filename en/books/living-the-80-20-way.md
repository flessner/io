# Living the 80/20 Way
If you only give yourself 20% of the week to complete a project,
you'll work way more efficiently. (See [[parkinsons-law]])

Focus on the 20% of your life you *actually* care about and concentrate
how you can impact them **as much as possible** with the **least effort**.
While min-maxing your life this way keep tabs on your *happiness*.

Simplicity is key to a good life, as **Epicurus** once said:
> The basic components of a good life are food, shelter, clothes, friends, freedom and thought

One way to achieve this is to cut out everything that *doesn't* make you happy.
