## Tech
This Site is hosted on GitHub Pages and also available as a [Repository](https://github.com/flessner/site).
The content is all just some Markdown files with [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/).
As a style it uses a modified version of GitHub's [Primer](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer) Theme.
